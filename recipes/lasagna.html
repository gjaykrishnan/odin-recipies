    <h2>Description</h2>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>6 uncooked lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>3 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese, divided</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>Â¼ cup hot water</li>
        <li>1 cube chicken bouillon</li>
        <li>1 (26 ounce) jar spaghetti sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Step 1<p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</p>
        </li>
        <li>Step 2 <p>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water,
                stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain, rinse with cold water,
                and set aside.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Step 3<p>Meanwhile, place chicken in a saucepan with enough water to cover; bring to a boil. Cook until
                chicken is no longer pink and the juices run clear, about 20 minutes. Remove chicken from the saucepan
                and shred.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Step 4
            <p>Combine shredded chicken, 1 cup mozzarella cheese, and cream cheese in a large bowl. Dissolve hot water
                and bouillon in a liquid measure; pour over chicken mixture and stir until well combined.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Step 5
            <p>Spread 1/3 of the spaghetti sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Cover with 1/2 of the chicken
                mixture and top with 3 lasagna noodles; repeat. Top with remaining sauce and sprinkle with remaining 1
                cup mozzarella cheese.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Step 6
            <p>Bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes. </p>
        </li>
    </ol>
